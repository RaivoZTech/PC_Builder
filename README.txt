To run the application in local host ,you need to 
compile the back_end folder in any IDE,and run it. I used InteliJ for back-end.

To run the front end ,you need to have react installed on your computer ,

open "user_authentication" folder in CMD

Then run the command in cmd "npm start" 

After a while your web browser should pop up, bringing you to the apps login page.

Make sure you are running the front-end on port:3000, and back-end on port: 8080

I also included the SQL database dump file to gather the database structure.
